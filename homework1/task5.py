# TASK 5: Lists and Dictionaries 

# create a list of your favorite books, including book titles and authors 
# (I don't read books as often as I used to, but I love music so I will be making a list of some of my favorite albums instead)
my_favorite_albums = ["E - Ecco2k", "Slide - George Clanton", "Warlord - Yung Lean", "Age Of - Oneohtrix Point Never", "The OOZ - King Krule"]

# use list slicing to print the first three books in the list 
print(my_favorite_albums[0:3])

# create a dictionary that represents a basic student database, including student names and IDs
student_database = {
    "name": "Sam Allen",
    "ID": "IDK!"
}
