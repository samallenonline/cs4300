## Setup Instructions 
In order to run this application, you will need access to DevEdu. 
(Note to grader: I am aware that you are supposed to login to my DevEdu environment and start the application from there, so I am writing these instructions with that assumption in mind.)

1. Login to DevEdu 
2. Click the "Environments" button
3. Click the "Containers" button
4. Click the "Extend" button on the container named "samallenonline"
5. Click the "Editor" button to access the development environment
6. Create a new terminal and enter these lines of code

```cd cs4300/homework2_rework```

```source samallenonline_env2.2/bin/activate```

```python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3000 ```

7. In a new tab, navigate back to the Devedu container
8. Click the "App" button to access the running application
9. Add the string "/bookings/" to the end of the URL

You should now be able to use the application. Please login with the test user that I have created for testing and grading purposes. The login credentials are as follows:

Username: test

Password: test

## AI Usage 
ChatGPT was utilized to generate code for certain sections of this project. AI-generated code was used to complete parts 3.3, 3.4 and 3.6 of the assignment, as well as for general debugging. The AI-generated content was used for reference, and most of the code for the HTML templates was taken directly from chatGPT given my time constraints.
